    A theoretically perfect clustering, structurally-wise, would be one formed by
    clique-like clusters completely disconnected from the others, as this
    configuration would allow for maximum internal density for each of the clusters
    and maximum sparsity of connections between them. Graph clustering quality
    metrics are models that try to evaluate how close to theoretically perfect a
    given cluster is, scoring them accordingly.
